    %h2 My approach to counseling
    p As your counselor, I welcome you and will establish an atmosphere of acceptance, safety, and honesty. I combine respect, humor, and &#8220;courageous inquisitiveness&#8221; to support you, help you stand up to what's holding you back and sustain positive changes.
    p I support setting clear, attainable goals, utilizing creativity, personal strengths, courage, and humor to overcome obstacles. I will help you cultivate being more fully present in each daily moment, to reflect clearly and respond effectively and compassionately to whatever challenges occur in your life.
    p My ability to be humorous, patient, relaxed, focused and confident helps my clients tackle their problems in a supportive, informal, but goal-focused and challenging atmosphere.
